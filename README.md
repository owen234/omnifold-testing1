## Sandbox for exploring OmniFold

Various tests.

Some things were taken or adapted from Ben Nachman's OmniFold tutorial.  https://github.com/hep-lbdl/OmniFold

Here's a few descriptions of things that are in here.

- **multivariate_normal.ipynb** :  Simple code to generate random numbers from a multivariate normal distribution.

- **roofit-testing-rf611.ipynb** :  Jupyter notebook adaptation of $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit/rf611_weightedfits.C
